# f23c7-Dockerfiles

This repository provides Dockerfiles based on CentOS7 and Fedora23.

The goal of this experiment is to figure out, if we can use the same entrypoint
scripts, the same 'image building logic' producing a unified behavior of the
container, while using either CentOS7 or Fedora23 as a base.
